# OBJECT DETECTION USING ATMEGA 328
## THEORY
This project demonstrates distance of obstacles within threshold limit using ultrasonic sensor on Atmega328 chip. Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance of an object.An algorithm is developed for distance detection,on an Atmega328 that acts as control board. LED glowing indicates when distance exceeded than threshold value.All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.
## SIMULATION
The functionality of the object detection is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using simuation in a software called SimulIDE. Below shows two images where in the 1st image shows the status of the simulation when threshold value not exceeded than limit value and the second image shows the status of the system when threshold value exceeded than limit value.

## SWOT ANALYSIS

### STRENGTH
*	This project helps to find an distance of the object by the sensor.
*	LED glows immediately when sensor coverage exceed than threshold value limit.
### WEAKNESS
*	LED will glow or not glow only based on threshold value.if not threshold value means it wont work.
### OPPORTUNITY
*	The proposed model is used in parking systems and drinks manufacturing company.
*	This project does not require any man power.
### THREAT
*	The project would have operational shortcomings in case of power failure.

## 4W's AND 1H's

### WHO
This is used by the staff at the parking lot and operators at manufacturing companies
### WHAT
This method is used by the staff of the parking lot to know whether a vacant space there for parking and is used in cooldrinks manufacturing companies to know measurement of drinks loaded bottle during packaging of drinks.
### WHEN
This method is useful when there is a need of tons of manufacturing cooldrinks in short period of time.so if it is used, packaging time will be reduced.
### WHERE
This method can be deployed in food and softdrinks manufacturing companies.
### HOW
This program can be executed in a system which has linux or windows operating system.
