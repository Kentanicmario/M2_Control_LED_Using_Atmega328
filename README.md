# OBJECT DETECTION USING ATMEGA 328
## THEORY
This project demonstrates the obstacle detection and distance of obstacle using ultrasonic sensor on Atmega328 chip. Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance of an object.An algorithm is developed for obstacle detection,on an Atmega328 that acts as control board. LED glowing indicates when ultrasonic sensor find any objects in the limited range.All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.
## SIMULATION
The functionality of the object detection is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using simuation in a software called SimulIDE. Below shows two images where in the 1st image shows the status of the simulation when the system is OFF and the second image shows the status of the system when it is ON.
