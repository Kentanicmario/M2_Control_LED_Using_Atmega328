# DISTANCE DETECTION USING ATMEGA 328
## THEORY
This project demonstrates distance of obstacles within threshold limit using ultrasonic sensor on Atmega328 chip. Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance of an object.An algorithm is developed for distance detection,on an Atmega328 that acts as control board. LED glowing indicates when distance exceeded than threshold value.All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.
## SIMULATION
The functionality of the object detection is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using simuation in a software called SimulIDE.
