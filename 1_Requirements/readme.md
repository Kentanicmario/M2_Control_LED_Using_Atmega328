# OBJECT DETECTION USING ATMEGA 328
## RESEARCH
This project demonstrates the obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensor on Atmega328 chip. Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance of an object.An algorithm is developed for obstacle detection,on an Atmega328 that acts as control board. LED glowing indicates when ultrasonic sensor find any objects in the limited range.All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.

## SWOT ANALYSIS

### STRENGTH
*	This project helps to find a parking slot for the vehicles that arrive at the parking lot.
*	It efficiently tracks and allots the slots for the cars.
### WEAKNESS
*	During code compilation runtime errors or any other errors can lead to traffic blocks and confusion at the parking spots.
### OPPORTUNITY
*	The proposed model is less time consuming and hassle free.
*	Provides necessary guidelines to make parking process smoother altogether.
*	This project can be operated with minimal man power requirement.
### THREAT
*	The project would have operational shortcomings in case of power failure.
# 4W's AND 1H's
### WHO
This is used by the staff at the parking lot.
### WHAT
This method is used by the staff of the parking lot to facilitate the vehicles of those individuals who wish to park them.
### WHEN
This method is useful when there is a lot of traffic caused by vehicles waiting for parking slot.
### WHERE
This method can be deployed in places where there are lot of people and they want to park their vehicles such as mall, cinema theatre, hospitals.
### HOW
This program can be executed in a system which has linux or windows operating system.
