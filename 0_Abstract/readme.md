# OBJECT DETECTION USING ATMEGA 328
## ABSTRACT
This project explains the obstacle detection and distance of obstacles using ultrasonic sensor on Atmega328 chip. Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance of an object.An algorithm is developed for obstacle detection,on an Atmega328 that acts as control board. LED glowing indicates when ultrasonic sensor find any objects in the limited range.All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.The ultrasonic sensor detects the distance of the object by using threshold value , the light glows when the object detects within the threshold limit. It is used in parking area to know the empty space for vehicle parking and it is also used in cooldrinks company to load the drinks bottle with correct measurement.
